# 🧙‍♂️ HP SwiftUI App

A small SwiftUI project that fetches and displays data from a local **Harry Potter JSON** file.  
Originally built just to explore **SwiftUI** and experiment with some of the **iOS 18 (26.0 SDK)** features and styling.

---

## 🪄 Overview

The app loads data about characters from the wizarding world of Harry Potter — including names, houses, ancestry, and other fun details.  
It’s a simple demo that focuses on working with **JSON decoding**, **struct models**, and **SwiftUI layouts**.

There’s a **search bar UI**, but the actual search logic isn’t wired up yet. I was mostly using this to play around with UI design and learn more about the new SwiftUI APIs.

## 🧰 Features

- Fetches character data from a **local JSON file**
- Displays characters in a scrollable list
- Basic navigation to detail views
- Attempted search UI (feature not completed)
- Experimentation with **SwiftUI**, **Codable**, and **modern iOS UI patterns**

---

## 🚧 Status

No longer in active development.  
I got a bit bored with this one and decided to move on to projects that feel more meaningful and worth my time.  
Still, it was a good little test run for learning how iOS 26 design features look and feel.

---

## 🪶 Notes

Built with:
- SwiftUI  
- Xcode 16  
- iOS 18 SDK  

JSON data was adapted from a Harry Potter dataset (for educational/demo purposes only).

## 💭 Final Thoughts

This was a fun side project for a bit, but time to move on to something I actually value spending time on.  
Maybe it’ll still help someone else learn how to decode JSON into Swift models or build simple SwiftUI layouts.
